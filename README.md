# Text-Generation
Text generation program. The program is based on a machine learning algorithm. Using statistical
techniques known as Markov Processes and Monte Carlo methods, the program “learns” the style of
the text that you feed it (assuming that the text is sufficiently long). The program then proceeds to
happily generate nonsense texts written in the same style, and in any desirable length.
